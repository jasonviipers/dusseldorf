# Installing Dusseldorf

Dusseldorf is meant tot be run "online", as it is meant to be a DNS server which needs to be available at all times, if you are testing resources in the public Internet.  That way, you cannot "install" Dusseldorf on your machine and use it in the cloud.

## Requirements
- Server with preferably 2 public IPv4 addresses. 
- Container orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes.
